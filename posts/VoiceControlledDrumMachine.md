A few months ago I saw somewhere on Twitter that somebody developed a voice controller record player. 
That’s inspired me to try to make a voice-controlled midi device. 
I was very excited so it took only about two relaxed days to develop. 
Back in that days I only had one midi device LXR Digital Drum Synth so that’s why this project based on this machine.

To continue you have to choices:

The first one is just to watch short video demonstration to check how it works.


The other one is going deeper. 
[Visit GitHub page](https://github.com/minikin/VoiceControlledDrumMachine) of the project and try to make it by yourself.
